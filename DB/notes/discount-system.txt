    Usage:
DocumentID, manual discount, manual discount type (% vs $)
Possible param: boolean to indicate whether or not to update preinventorymov?

    Calculations:
Lots of data is selected from the preinventorymov table, such as the unit price,
whether it has a "Special" price or not. see sp_PreSale_CalcPrice.txt.

    Return Table:
* Unit discount (per quantity 1, rounded to 4 decimals) 
* Extended discount (rounded to 2 decimals)
* Order total discount (amount discounted from the entire order) will
be calculated with sum() on the result table.

Questions:
    * PreInventoryMov.Discount is a "per-each-Qty"
    * How do I get IDGroup from a DocumentID? Is it from the Model table?
        + I already figured this out.

Description:
    Each SP returns 0 for success -- no error numbers/messages yet. In the future
    they may throw an exception.
    
Notes:
    There is always only a single IDPessoa associated with a given DocumentID, so
    it is safe to use with the equals operator instead of the IN() operator.
    But if you want to join it to something, it would be PreInvInvoice.IDCustomer.
    
    
Always stackable:
    Frequent Buyer
    %X off subtotal
    

First, if the item has a special price (i.e. entry in the special price table),
only manual discounts apply, nothing else (exit early).

Select the greatest single discount from the following five.

1) Customer File Discount: Ent_CustomerDiscount - joins pessoa on IDTipoPessoa
and model on idgroup/groupid; % Off based on group item is in. Convert % to
amount for comparison (which of the 6 is the highest discount) but keep
percentage as a second col.
2) Promo Sale - Sale Price - Specify amount item price will end up at.  Must
then calculate what discount should be.
3) Promo Sale - Amount Off - Specifies discount amount that will be subtracted. (-$2)
4) Promo Sale - Percent Off - Specify discount percentage to then calculate
the amount to be subtracted.
5) Promo Sale - BOGO - Buy X, Get X or Buy X, Get Y.  This get quantity could
also allow a % off that qty.  IE: Buy 2 shows, get third pair at 50% off.
