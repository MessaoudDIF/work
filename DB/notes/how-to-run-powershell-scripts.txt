In order to run powershell scripts, you may need to change some configuration
parameters on your system. One method is to do the following:

 * Start
 * In the "Search programs and files" box, type "PowerShell" but do not press
   the Enter key. Five entries should appear under the "Programs (5)" heading.
 * Right click on "Windows PowerShell"
 * Select "Run as administrator"
 * Select "Yes" to the User Access Control
 * Enter the following command in the PowerShell:
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass
 * Enter "Y" at the prompt asking "Do you want to change the execution policy?"
