Changes to PawCom from V2.7.0 to V2.7.1
=======================================

1. For version 2006 Peachtree moved the address information out of the customer and vendor
   records into a separate address file.  This means that for V2006 there is additional
   overhead associated with getting the customer and vendor BillTo/MailTo/ShipTo addresses.
   In PawCom 2.7.0 the way that we implemented this additional overhead was not very
   efficient and resulted in much longer times to read customer and vendor records.  In
   PawCom 2.7.1 we have rewritten the code for getting the addresses, resulting in much
   faster times to read the customer and vendor records.

2. A problem with the SelectJob form that caused a fatal error when there were JobIDs
   longer than 16 characters was fixed.

3. A problem with retrieving vendor MailTo and RemitTo addresses was corrected.

4. For the Default Employee EE records and the Employee EE records the amount for
   non-calculated fields was always being set to 0.  The problem has been corrected.

5. SalesOrderJournal.NotePrintsAfterItem was not being returned correctly.  The problem
   has been corrected.

8. For the Purchase Journal class the method GetForInvoice was added.

9. Starting with Peachtree version 11.5 the component properties were moved from
   the LineItem records to the BOMHistory and BOMItems records.  In order to maintain
   some backward compatibility the component properties of the LineItem class for
   assemblies now returns the most recent revision of the BOM data.

10. A new class for V13 has been added: AFLOCAT.  Properties of this class return
    data used in Peachtree's pull-down location lists.

11. A new function mwSave_GeneralJournal has been added to Access.  This function inserts
    a new General Journal transaction into Peachtree and can do so with in RealTime mode.
    The data for the transaction is supplied to the function with some simple structures.
    The function does a thorough validation of the data supplied.  If the data is valid
    then the transaction is inserted into the Peachtree Database.  If the transaction
    needs to be posted, the function performs that operation also.  The routine
    DemoWriteToGeneralJournal now calls this routine to provide a much better example
    of generating a General Journal transaction.

Problems Fixed
--------------
1. Corrected several problems in the code for Access module "Support Functions 2",
   used by General Ledger and Balance Sheet reports.

2. In Access module Line Item Functions routines "mw{To/From}Table_LineItemHeader"
   a problem was corrected where WarrantyPeriod and WarrantySpan were not being
   read or written.

3. In Access function "DemoWriteToSalesJrnl" added conditional statements to include
   freight line only if FreightAmount <> 0.

4. For the Chart class the field Inactive was not being returned on a read for some
   versions of Peachtree.  The problem has been corrected.

5. Modify Access routine mwSetBatchMode in Support Functions so that it doesn't
   update if RealTime = False.

6. The Access Receive Payment for Invoice form, when used with BCS data, now returns
   a date in the current accounting year instead of for the current date.

7. A problem with closing the Access Receive Payment for Invoice form has been
   corrected. 

8. For Peachtree versions >= 11.5 PayrollJournal.JobHours was not being read or
   written.  The problem has been corrected.

9. A problem was corrected on the Access Maintain Customer form where clicking an
   Invoice on the Invoice History tab was not showing detail data.

10. A problem was corrected on the Maintain Line Item and Maintain Vendor forms
    where clicking New then clicking Cancel on the pop-up form would leave a
    character in the ID field.

11. On the Maintain Customer form Note and Task tabs when the Edit screen appeared
    the OK or CANCEL button had to be clicked twice.  Also when CANCEL was checked
    a new record was generated.  These problems have been corrected.

12. There was a problem on the Sales/Invoicing form in Access where, when an
    existing invoice was selected the detail was not showing properly.  The problem
    has been corrected.

Changes to PawCom from V2.5.3 to V2.6.0

7. Sales Invoicing form in Access now correctly displays invoices with closed sales orders.

8. Sales Invoicing form in Access now shows the lists of invoices in correct sort order.

9. The query "qry Sales by Sales Rep Report" was modified to select only records with
   TrxType = 0 so that duplicate entries would not appear on the Sales by Sales Rep report.

10. A report "Paid Invoices by Sales Rep" was added along with a supporting query.

11. Several problems were fixed up related to item aging:
    a. A field TrxDate was added to the table "Temporary Item Aging".
    b. In the routine BuildTemporaryItemAging in module "Support Functions 3" a line was
       added to generate RS!TrxDate = ReportDate and several other problems were corrected.
    c. In the query "qry Aged Inventory 1" the field TrxDate was added. 

12. A problem in the function "mwPeriodForDate" was corrected.

13. A problem was corrected where sometimes all functions mwWrite_* were not positioning

Changes to PawCom from V2.5.2 to V2.5.3
=======================================

New Functionality
-----------------
1. Added support for Peachtree Premium 2004 Manufacturing and Distribution versions.
   This includes the addition of several new tables for these versions.

2. Added SelectJob form to library.

3. Added total weight and weight per item to queries underlying the Sales Invoice
   report temporary source tables.  The weights were not added to the report itself
   - this is left as an exercise for the reader.

4. Added EditCount field to all journal classes for V2004.

Problems Fixed
--------------
1. Fixed problem with Ticket.CompletedForID where it was not creating correct data
   for jobs.

2. Fixed problem with writing SalesJournal.ShipDate property.

3. Corrected problem where Sales Invoicing form was defaulting to March 15.

4. Fixed problem with AssemblyAdjustmentJournal.ReasonForBuild for V2003 and V2004.

5. Modified table and form "Filtered Report" to fix problem with Report Date and
   removed date range for Aged Receivables reports.

6. Fixed problem with property Ticket.RecordedByID where it was returning the wrong
   value for vendors in V11.

7. In the Sales Journal Header and Temporary Sales Journal Header the field length
   of CustomerName was increased from 30 to 39 to fix an error in the Sales/Invoice
   form on Print or Save when custumer's name was > 30 characters.

8. The Aged Inventory Report filter on line items now works correctly.

9. Corrected problem where the Default Inventory Data was not being refreshed.

10. The General Ledger and General Ledger Trial Balance reports now include a
    SysCost adjustment found on the equivalent reports generated by Peachtree
    that correct cost of sales for inventory items whose quantity went negative
    and were then replenished at a different price.


Changes to PawCom from V2.5.1 to V2.5.2
=======================================

New Functionality
-----------------
1. An Aged Inventory report has been added to the Access front end.  It can be
   found under Reports:Line Items:Aged Inventory on the menu bar.

Problems Fixed
--------------
1. For the Employee class the property DateHired was returning an empty value
   for Peachtree 2002, 2003, and 2004.   The property DateLastRaise for Peachtree
   2004 was returning with an odd value rather than returning empty (because
   the data is now located in the RaiseHistory class.

2. A description for the property JrnlTypeEx has been added to the Purchase Journal
   and Sales Journal classes.

3. Some minor cosmetic problems were corrected in the manual.

4. The Microsoft Calendar Control used by the SetDate class has problems on systems
   running both OfficeXP and WindowsXP.  The problem was fixed by eliminating the
   use of the Microsoft control and replacing it with a built-in proprietary control.

5. For the MemorizedTransactions class the VendorID in the transaction header was
   not being set correctly.  The problem has been corrected.

6. For several journals the description of the DetailFlag2 property in the manual
   has been rewritten to clarify the roll of this field with reimbursable expenses.

Changes to PawCom from V2.5.0 to V2.5.1
=======================================

Problems Fixed
--------------
1. In the forms Maintain Customers 2, Maintain Line Items and Maintain Vendors
   the function UpdateCurrentRecord was not setting the GUID for new V10(2003)
   and V11(2004) records.  This didn't create a noticable problem for V10, but
   for V11 the GUID must be unique so after the first record was added with an
   empty GUID attempts to enter additional records with an empty GUID gave a
   Btrieve error 5 (Duplicate key value).  The function was modified in the
   three forms to correct this problem.

2. Occasionally Peachtree tax tables end up with duplicate records.  In this case
   refreshing the tax table data was causing duplicate record messages to be
   generated because the table defined the field CodeID as a unique index. The
   problem was corrected by removing the two indices in this table.

3. On the form "Filtered Reports" several of the controls wre not sorting in
   Ascending order.  The controls have been edited to correct this.

4. For the class CompanyInformation in the manual the method name "Save" was incorrect.
   The manual was edited to change this method's name to "Update".

5. In the file PawData250.mdb for the table "Vendor Lookup" the length of "Name" field
   was not long enough for recent versions.  The length of this field was changed from
   30 to 39.

6. When printing an invoice on the PawCom Sales/Invoice form for a V11(2004) company
   an error message would pop up because of a missing field in the "Temporary Sales
   Journal Detail" table.  This problem was corrected by adding a text field GUID
   of length 39 with Allow Zero Length = True.

7. For reports that were filtered by Sales Rep the report was generating an error
   message if the Peachtree data had no employee records that were marked as being
   sales reps.  The form  "Filtered Reports" was modified to correct this problem.

8. Some of the Microsoft redistributable ddl, tlb and ocx components were accidentally
   left out of the kits.  The kit build procedures have been modified to include these
   components.

9. On page 6 of the manual in the section on Registered Files the files fm20.dll and
   comcat.dll were left off the list.  The manual has been revised to include them.

10. For any property of type string, if the string specified was longer than the field
    on an update or insert, then the next physical field in the record was being
    overwritten.  For example, if the BillToState of a customer record was specified
    as four or more characters, then the BillToZipcode would be overwritten.  And if
    the BillToState was specified as three characters, then reading the BillToState
    would return the state plus zipcode.  This problem has been corrected in the PawCom
    library.

11. On the Filtered Reports form the StartDate control allowed a value to be entered
    manually but the EndDate did not.  The StartDate field behavior was made consistent
    with the EndDate so that the user could not enter an invalid date.

12. For the "Items Sold to Customers" report when an explicit date range was specified
    for the report a box would pop up asking for a TrxDate and the report would not
    limit data to the specified date range.  The problem was with the underlying query
    "qry Items Sold to Customers" did not include the TrxDate as one of its fields.
    The problem was corrected by adding TrxDate to the query's fields.

13. For the reports "Sales by Item", "Sales by Item Summary" and "Sales by Sales Rep"
    the filtering by state was using the ShipTo state on the invoice.  In actual practice
    the ShipTo state if often not filled in on invoices, which caused many entries to be
    missed when a state range was selected.  The state filtering was modified to use the
    customer BillTo state, which produces more meaningful state-filtered reports.  To
    accomplish this modification the hidden field ShipToState on the three reports was
    changed to BillToState, the queries "qry Sales by Item Report" and "qry Sales by
    Sales Rep Report" were modified to contain the customer BillToState, and the code
    in the Filtered Reports form for the filter Where Clause was changed from selecting
    the ShipToState to selecting the BillToState.

14. For the class SortJob the manual describes four properties starting with "Unknown"
    that actually have been identified and are now obsolete:
	Unknown1: identified as ItemIndex
	Unknown2: identified as JournalCode
	Unknown3: identified as CostOfSalesTrx
	Unknown4: identified as Quote + Subindex2

15. The Job Profitability report was indicating that there was no data available because
    a line had accidentally been commented out in the code behind the report.  To fix the
    problem in "rpt Job Profitability" in the routine Report_Open the comment character (')
    was removed from the line that reads "BuildProfitabilityTable".

16. For V11(2004) Expense Tickets that referenced a job with or without phases and costs,
    the CompletedForID fields in the Tickets table was not showing the JobID.  This problem
    has been corrected in the PawCom library.

17. For the Customer, LineItem and Vendor classes in the manual the description of the
    Index property has been modified to say "for creating new records set the Index = 0
    and Btrieve will generate the correct value for the Index."

18. The functions mwUpdateAll_I and UpdateFlagged_* where * = Customer, Employee, LineItem
    or Vendor tried a GetEqual method on the appropriate ID to determine whether the record
    was an update or an insert of a new record.  This meant that the ID could not be changed
    or the status of the record might be incorrect.  To get around this problem the method
    used was changed to GetForIndex on the appropriate index.  This applies to all versions
    from V7 forward except for Employee records, which only started using an index at
    V11(2004).  For earlier Employee records the GetEqual method is used.


Changes to PawCom from V2.4.3 to V2.5.0
=======================================

New Functionality
-----------------
1. Added support for Peachtree 2004 (V11).  Some changes in the database were necessary
   to include this support:
   a. Chart: The number of Budget periods now goes from 0 to 55 for V11.
   b. Chart: eCheckID is no longer used for V11.
   c. Chart: a new detail field, Revised(0 to 28), has appeared in V11.
   d. Chart: a new header field, Unknown(1 to 216), has appeared in V11.
   e. Chart: a new header field, Internal1(1 to 21), has appeared in V11.
   f. mwReadAll_Charts function modified for V11.
   g. Customer: the properties FormDeliveryFlags and LastUpdateCounter have appeared in V11.
      The FormDeliveryFlags property is interpreted as follows:
	Value	Deliver by Paper	Deliver by Email   CC Sales Rep
	-----   ----------------	----------------   ------------
	  0		Yes			No		No
	  1		No			Yes		No
	  4		Yes			No		Yes
	  5		No			Yes		Yes
   h. Employee: header property DateLastRaise no longer used in V11.
   i. Employee: a new header field, Index, has appeared in V11.
   j. Employee: the range on some properties has changed for V11:
	EEUnused(i)	previously: i = 1 to 16		V11: i = 1 to 4
	Unused0(i)	previously: i = 1 to 241	V11: i = 1 to 257
	Unused4(i)	previously: i = 1 to 56		V11: i = 1 to 32
   k. Company Information:  the range of some properties has changed for V11:
	Unknown1(i)	previously: version dep.	V11: i = 1 to 83
	Unused11(i)	previously: i = 1 to 107	V11: i = 1 to 83
   l. Employee: the property Unused0, which was previously empty, seems to have occasional
      values in V11.  Specifically, bytes at index 62, 126, 190, and 254 have a value of
      1.  This seems to be an artifact - setting these indices to 0 doesn't appear to
      have any effect.
   m. DefaultTaxTypes: the property Unknown is no longer used in V11.
   n. DefaultCustomerData: the range of the property Unused11 has changed for V11:
	Unused11(i)	previously: i = 1 to 2685	V11: i = 1 to 1281
      For V11 (and V10) the property Unused11 text has been observed at the following
      index values:
	Index		Contents
	-----           --------
	8 or 20		"10001"
	  29		"m101"
	  50		"m10001"
	  71		"m101"
      The meaning of these values is unknown - they may just be artifacts.
      The following fields appeared in V11:
	Unused2(1 to 20)	Byte
	Unused3			Integer
	Unused4			Byte
	Unused5(1 to 3)		Integer
	Unused6(1 to 9)		Byte
   o. DefaultVendorData:  the property Unused5 was added.  This property actually
      appeared in earlier versions but was not exposed in PawCom.  The field is
      indexed as follows:
	V7	1 to 4208
	V8-V10	1 to 4194
	V11	1 to 2778
      For V11 text has been observed at the following index values:
	Index		Contents
	-----		--------
	   1		"000011"
	   2		"00050"
	  22		"m101"
      The meaning of these values is unknown - they may just be artifacts.
   p. DefaultEmployeeData: The following properties appeared in V11:
	Unknown1		Integer
	Unknown2		Integer
	Unknown3(1 to 22)	Byte 
      The property Unknown3 has been observed to contain the text "101" for V11.
      The meaning of this value is unknown - it may be just an artifact.
   q. GeneralData: the property Unknown1(1 to 96) 1 has been added for V11.
      For V11 the property Unused10 is obsolete and has become part of Unknown11.
      Unknown11 has been observed to sometimes contain a value 128 at byte 2
      and a value 2 or 3 at byte 3.  The meaning of these values is unknown.
   r. All journals:  a property DetailGUID (DetailJobGUID and DetailPayGUID for
      payroll and just GUID for JrnlRow) appeared in V11.
   s. All journals:  a property DetailDateCleared appeared in the CDJ, CRJ, GJ
      and PaJ for V11.
   t. RaiseHistory appeared in V11.  A class has been added to support the data.
   u. Vendor: the following properties appeared in V11:
	EmployeeIndex
	FormsDeliveryFlags (Email = 1, ccPurchaseRep = 8)
   v. Users:  two new properties appeared in V11:  System_File_ReconsilidateCompany
      and GeneralLedger_Maint_Budgets.
   w. MemorizedTransactions: For V11 the following changes appeared:
	The AddressPresent property is no longer used.
	The DetailUnused2 maximum index has changed from 41 to 25.
	A new property was added: DetailUnused6(1 to 52).
	
2. Chart: a new method, GetForAccountID, has been added.

3. Employee: a new method, GetForIndex, was added.

4. JrnlHdr: additional values have been noted for the property JrnlTypeEx
	Journal	Value
        ------- -----
	  SJ	  2	for V10 credit memos
	  PJ	  3	for V10 credit memos
	  CD	  1	for V8, V9, V10 with no check #

5. Employee: added comment in the Employee class documentation that the PawCom property
   Pension is called Retirement Plan on the Peachtree Maintain Employee form
   and the PawCom property Deferred is called Statuory Employee on the Peachtree
   form.

6. Employee: added CacheCharts method.  In V11 the record structure was changed so
   that the chart data needs to be referenced for each employee.  When reading all
   employee's this can slow the read time down significantly - by caching the chart
   data most of this overhead can be eliminated.

7. Ticket: the meaning of some unused fields has been identified and new properties
   added:
	Unused2 --> StartSeconds
	Unused3 --> StopSeconds
        Unused4 --> BreakSeconds
	Unused5 --> DurationSeconds

8. AuditTrail: For V9, V10 and V11, JournalID has been replaced by UnknownL.

9. Ticket:  Added the following methods:
	GetFirst
	GetGreaterThan (TicketNumber)
	GetGreaterThanOrEqual (TicketNumber)
	GetLast
	GetLessThan (TicketNumber)
	GetLessThanOrEqual (TicketNumber)
	GetNext
	GetPrevious

10. User: comments added to documentation that the following properties appear
    with a different name on the Peachtree User form:
	System_File_IntegrityCheck	-->	Data Verification
	System_Tasks_LinkToOtherApps	-->	COM & DDE Data Access
	CreditCardAccess		-->	Credit Card Center

11. The Filtered Reports form has been reworked to provide more filter
    options and an improved interface.

12. Documentation for adding filtered reports has been added.

13. Documentation on accounting periods in Peachtree has been expanded.

14. Added functions mwCustomerBalance(CustomerID,BalanceDate) and
    mwVendorBalance(VendorID,BalanceDate) to module Support Functions 3.

15. A VB.NET example has been added to the kit.

16. The ability to filter reports by Ship To State, Customer Type, and Item Type
    has bee added to the filter form and these three types of filters have been
    included for the Sales by Item, Sales by Item Summary, and Sales by Sales
    Rep reports.

17. The Unknown fields for the SortJob class have been identified and new
    properties have been added:
	Item Index	was Unknown1
	JournalCode	was Unknown2
	CostOfSalesTrx	was Unknown3
	Quote		was part of Unknown4
	Subindex2	was part of Unknown4

18. For the PurchaseOrderJournal class the property CustomerInvoiceNumber was
    added.  This is identical with the property DropShipInvoiceNumber but the
    new name makes it easier to associate the property with the corresponding
    name on the 2004 PO form.

19. For the JrnlRow class a new property AccountIndex has been added.  This
    is the index for the account returned in AccoundID, so the two properties
    return the same chart info in a different form.

Problems Fixed
--------------
1. Customer class: a problem was fixed with the UseStandardTerms property where the
   value was always returning false for V9 and V10.

2. Vendor class: a problem was fixed with the UseStandardTerms property where the
   value was always returning false for V9 and V10.

3. DefaultCustomerData: documentation was corrected for Unused10 and Unused11 - they
   are actually indexed properties.

4. JobData: a problem with the Insert method where it was generating a "bad key"
   error has been corrected.

5. qry Inventory Sales: fixed query to select only TrxType = 0 to prevent it from
   selecting multiple lines on the Inventory Sales reports.  Also query was pulling
   up both Invoices and Quotes - it was modified to get only Invoices.

6. Ticket: an error in the documentation for the GetEqual method was corrected.

7. The General Ledger and General Ledger Trial Balance reports were producing
   significantly different results from Peachtree.  The problem has been corrected.

8. The "Items Sold to Customers" report was providing incorrect results in some
   cases.  The routine that generated the data for this report was completely
   rewritten to produce results similar to those of the Peachtree report of the
   same name.  The difference is that Peachtree's report includes non-item lines
   in its report and the PawCom report does not.  We are not sure if this is a
   question of interpretation about what the "Gross Margin" column means on the
   report or is due to a bug in Peachtree.

9. When the Demo:Update Flagged function was run from the menu bar it would only
   update the flagged items but report that it had updated all items.  This
   problem has been corrected.

10. There were several problems on the Sales/Invoice form that were causing
    incorrect records to be created in some cases.  These problems were corrected.

11. A problem was fixed in writing Sales Detail and Sales Order records where
    the string length in some string variables was dropping the last character
    if the string was the maximum length.

12. In the SalesOrderJournal class the method ReadFirstForCustomer was producing
    and error.  The problem has been corrected.

13. There were several places in the Access code where database and recordset
    objects were being defined without explicitly declaring them as DAO objects.
    This could cause some confusion to Access since the same objects occur in
    ADO.  All these ambiguous references to database and recordset objects were
    located and modified to declare them explicitly as DAO objects.

14. For the SelectCompany class the form was not highlighting the company when
    the CompanyPath property was specified.

15. A problem was fixed where drilling down to item data on the History tab of
    the Maintain Customer form was hanging Access.

16. The open company form was not locating the default Peachtree data location
    for Peachtree Premium Accounting 2004 Accountants' Edition.  The problem
    has been corrected.

17. The tab order on the attach tables screen was out of order.  The problem
    has been corrected.

Changes to PawCom from V2.4.02 to V2.4.3
========================================

New Functionality
-----------------
1. The following functions have been added to the Inventory Cost functions
   module:
	mwInventoryQuantityOnHand
	mwInventoryCostAverage
	mwInventoryCostFIFO
	mwInventoryCostLIFO
	Build TemporaryQuantityOnHand
   to allow better handling of item costs.

2. A Clear method has been added to the Memorized Transactions class.

3. In the class JrnlRow a GetFirst(NRecord) and Get Next method have been
   added.

4. In the class PurchaseOrderJournal a ReadFirstForVendor(VendorIndex) and
   ReadNextByVendor method have been added.



Problems Fixed
--------------
1. Several queries were using the old Key filed to join header and detail.
   These were modified to use NRecord instead.

2. A bug in .IncrementBatchCount for all journals was fixed.

3. In the routine mwReadAll_InventoryAdjustmentJournal in the module
   "Inventory Adjustment Journal functions" the status count was not
   incrementing.  This has been corrected.

4. The method ReadFirstByCustomer for the Cash Receipts Journal and Sales
   Journal classes was modified to get around a problem of slow response
   when there were no records for the customer.

5. A problem in mwUpdate_LineItem that produced an error message under
   certain conditions was corrected.

6. In mwReadAll_LineItems R3 was not getting closed when not including
   history.  This problem has been corrected.

7. The RequestedByID property of the Ticket class was not restoring or
   setting properly.  This problem has been corrected.

8. The routine mwPeriodForDate was sometimes not returning the correct
   period for a date in January 2003.  The routine has been rewritten
   to correct this problem.  Also corrected code in several other places
   to deal with the same problem.

9. Under certain conditions the function PhoneFormat was generating an
   error.  This problem has been corrected.

10. The classes Select Customer, Select Line Item, and Select Vendor were
    not picking up the ID on re-entry.  This has been corrected.

11. On the Maintain Customer, Maintain Line Item, Maintain Vendor and
    Sales/Invoicing forms the appropriate Select form is popped up when
    the first character of the ID is entered.  This new behavior is
    consistent with Peachtree.

12. Corrected code in BuildGeneralLedger and BuildGeneralLedgerTrialBalance
    to generate results that are consistent with Peachtree's reports.

13. The DiscountDate for the SalesJournal class was not getting written
    correctly for V8 and V9.  The problem has been corrected.

14. Several error messages were referring to JOURNAL.DAT despite the
    PT version.  The references have been changed to "Journal".

15. The MaxTrxNumber property of the InventoryAdjustmentJournal class was
    returning a correct value.  The problem has been corrected.

16. The routine DemoWriteToInventoryAdjustmentJrnl has been cleaned up
    and made more general for completeness.

17. The ReadFirst and ReadNext methods of the Sales Journal class were
    not returning quotes for V8 and higher.  The problem has been corrected.

18. The document for the classes SalesJournal and SalesOrderJournal methods
    ReadFirstForCustomer and ReadNextByCustomer has been changed to indicate
    that these methods do not return quotes.

19. Fixed problem with all Select forms that was causing them to be positioned
    incorrectly when the underlying form was not pop-up.

20. For the JobEstimate class the GetEqual method was always returning a status
    of 6.  The problem has been corrected.

21. Documentation for the customer credit card fields has been changed to
    indicate these fields were added at V10, not V9.

22. The demonstration function Demo_AddNewVendor was not working for V10.
    The problem has been corrected.

23. The demonstration function Demo_AddNewCustomer was failing to include the
    GUID for V10.  The problem has been corrected.


Changes to PawCom from V2.4.01 to V2.4.02
=========================================

Problems Fixed
--------------
1. The CustomerPO property of the SalesOrderJournal class was not functioning
   properly for V8, V9 and V10.

2. The TrxNumber property of the AuditTrail class was not functioning properly.

3. In the User's Manual for the AuditTrail class the properties TrxNumber, Key,
   Period, Subindex1, and Subindex2 are now marked as being obsolete starting
   with V9.

4. In the User's Manual a comment for the JobTag class has been added indicating
   that it is obsolete after V7.

5. At V10 Peachtree changed the key for the journals from 8 bytes to 10 bytes.
   The key still contains the same five components: Period, TrxNumber, JournalID,
   Subindex1, and Subindex2, but TrxNumber has been increased from an Integer
   field to a Long field to allow more transactions in period 0.  Some changes
   in the Access front end that were affected by the new structure had been missed,
   causing errors when period 0 contained more than 2**15 transactions in any
   of the journals.  These problems have been corrected.  Also the property Key
   for all journals is now returned empty for V10.

6. Some V9 and V10 databases were generating errors on refresh of LineItem data
   when there were no price levels defined.

7. The SJ and CRJ method ReadFirstForCustomer and the PJ and CDJ method
   ReadFirstForVendor were not returning detail properly.

8. During a refresh of the Inventory Adjustment Journal the status line at the
   bottom of the Access screen was not advancing.

9. The SalesOrderJournal ReadFirst method was hanging the Access application
   when the starting period was greater than 0.


Changes to PawCom from V2.4 to V2.4.01
======================================

New Features
------------
1. For all module functions that move data from the Access tables to the
   PawCom class properties where the property is a string type a check is
   now made to be sure an attempt is not made to load the property with a
   null.  This makes write operations more reliable and robust.

2. The following properties were added to the LineItem class:
	string  PriceLevelName
	integer PriceLevelIndex
	integer PriceLevelUse
	integer PriceLevelMethod
	integer PriceLevelRounding
	double  PriceLevelMethodAmount
	double  PriceLevelSpecificCent
	double	PriceLevelPrice
	double	PriceLevel1Value
   to support the new Price Level functionality in PCAW V10.

3. Added the property JrnlHdr.MaxTrxNulberL(Period, JournalCode)

Problems Fixed
--------------
1. For PCAW V7 there was a problem with refreshing JrnlHdr and JrnlRow data.

2. In mwWrite_SalesOrderJournal the class was not being closed correctly if
   an error occured.

3. The SalesOrderJournal.CloseSalesOrder and PurchaseOrderJournal.CloseSalesorder
   properties were not getting saved properly on an insert or update for PCAW
   V8 or higher.

4. The Employee supporting tables
	Employee EE Detail
	Employee ER Detail
	Employee Pay Info
	Employee Payroll Detail
   were not getting cleared on a refresh, causing duplicate records.

5. On the Sales Invoicing form when, on a new invoice, if a Sales Order line
   shipped quanitity was added and a new item was added to the invoice then the
   invoice was not being created correctly in PCAW.

6. Some reports were not displaying or were producing a request for the value
   of DATEVAL when a date range filter was selected.

7. Some errors were corrected in the manual.


Changes to PawCom from V2.3.03 to V2.4
======================================

New Features
------------
1. Now supports V10.  See description of new methods and properties below.

2. Added Customer ShipTo Addresses and labels to PawTrack and Maintain Customer
   form.  You can now have as many ship to addresses as you want.

3. Added pop-up notes on invoices.  To enable this feature set the flag in the
   Options table.  This allows you to view customer notes when you invoice them.

4. SelectCompany, SelectCustomer, SelectEmployee, SelectLineItem, SelectSalesRep,
   SelectTaxCode and SelectVendor objects now return a status from the ShowOpen
   method: True if OK was clicked, False if Cancel was clicked.

5. The ExcludeInactive property of the SelectAccount, SelectCustomer, SelectEmployee,
   SelectLineItem, SelectSalesRep, and SelectVendor objects has been documented.

6. Modified sort on SelectInvoice pop-up of SalesInvoicing form so it sorts by
   Reference after Date.

7. Added function mwDateIsValid(Period, Date) to verify that a date is in the range
   for the specified period.  This is useful to call before writing journal records,
   which can give footing errors if the date is not valid for the period.

8. On all Select objects normally hold the previously selected value.  However, now
   reinitializing the object will clear the value.  Note:  the value desired should
   be loaded before calling ShowOpen.

9. An Open Sales by Job report has been added.

10. A status message has been added to DemoUpdateAll and DemoUpdateFlagged to report
    what was updated.

11. Cosmetic changes made to rpt Sales by Item Monthly and rpt Sales by Item Summary.

12. Added function mwWriteAll_AuditTr to assist in restoring damaged AUDITTR.DAT files.

13. Added Discount button to Sales/Invoicing.  This makes it easy to add a line
    to the invoice with a discount amount based of dollars or percent.

14. When refreshing journal data the status line at the bottom of the screen now
    shows a progress count so you know what is happening.

15. A new scheme has been created for the PawTrack data.  Previously the data for
    all companies was held in a single file.  Now separate PawTrack24.mdb files
    are placed in each company folder and these files hold only the records for
    that company.  This gets around a problem with the previous scheme where
    the company data folder could not be moved after the PawTrack file had
    records for that company.  It also insures that the PawTrack data gets backed
    up with the rest of the company data when a backup operation is performed in
    Peachtree.

16. Price level descriptions have been added to the Unit Price pull-down list on the
    Sales/Invoicing form.

17. An "Available Credit" field has been added to the Sales/Invoicing form.

18. Functions mwGetLastCost_InventoryCost and mwGetAverageCost_InventoryCost have
    been added to the module "Inventory Cost functions."

19. A Payment Defaults tab has been added to the Maintain Customer 2 form for V10.

20. Function mwPeriodForDate and mwStartDateForPeriod have been added to the
    module Support functions.

21. In the module Demonstration functions the function mwDemoWriteToSalesJrnl has
    been completely rewritten to be more understandable and general.  The setting
    of TrxDate for the other demo journal write functions has also been cleaned up.

Problems Fixed
--------------
The following problems have been corrected in V2.4:

1. There was an extraneous message box that appeared in the OpenCompany form.

2. The length of CustomerName in the "Temporary Items Sold To Customers" table
   was incorrectly set to 30 instead of 39.

3. On the Maintain Customer 2 form when tasks were pulled up for a customer,
   data from another company that had a customer with the same CustomerIndex
   would appear. (Actually fixed in qry Customer Tasks.)

4. Function mwDateAe was not handling a date value of null properly.

5. The queries "qry Sales by Item Monthly Summary" and "qry Sales by Item Report"
   were incorrectly including data from quotes.

6. In mwReadAll_LineItems there was a problem that was a causing some incorrect
   numbers in the Line Item History Report.  The problem was fixed by adding
   "qry Inventory Sales by Period" and modifying "mwUpdate_LineItemHistory".

7. SelectCompany was sometimes not returning CompanyName correctly.

8. Scrolling in SelectCustomer, SelectLineItem and SelectVendor objects was
   improved.

9. A problem prevented the Memorized Transaction report from running.

10. The SelectCustomer, SelectLineItem, and SelectVendor objects would fail with
    an Error=3 (file not open) message if the Cancel button was previously
    clicked and the ShowOpen method was invoked again.

11. On the Sales/Invoicing form for PAW (but not PCW) Sales Orders were not
    showing.

12. There was a problem in the Job Profitability Report for PAW (but not PCW).

13. The MemorizedTransactions object was not returning detail correctly for
    GJ records (type =1).

14. The Job data for a Payroll Journal record was using the LineNo and JobLevel
    inconsistently across versions.

15. There was a minor problem with the SalesOrderJournal object.

16. For the SalesJournal object the ReadNextByCustomer method was getting a
    premature EOF before the last customer record was reached.

17. On the Sales/Invoicing form Sales Order data was not being displayed after
    a previous invoice with Sales Order data had been pulled up.

18. On the Maintain Customer form the Invoice History tab was not always showing
    all history.

19. The TextInvoice form has a display problem with very long address strings.

20. On the Sales/Invoice form when a record was saved and an error occured, the
    form was cleared instead of retaining its data.

    filtering the records properly.

24. For the CashReceiptsJournal object the property Reference was not getting
    saved on an Insert or Update.

25. On the Maintain Customer form Invoice History tab the Sales This Month,
    Total Sales and Balance Due fields were sometimes incorrect.

26. The functions DemoWriteToPurchaseOrderJrnl and DemoWriteToSalesOrderJrnl
    were setting the field Extension to non-zero values for V7 instead of 0.

27. For V9 only the AuditTrail object was returning incorrect values in some
    fields.

28. For the AuditTrail object the fields EntryDate and EntryTime were not being
    saved properly on an insert or update.

29. On the Maintain Customer form Period History tab the display was showing
    future period data.

30. On the Maintain Customer form when data was deleted from some of the address
    fields an error would occur on a Save.

31. The function DemoWriteToTicketRegister was writing some incorrect data.

32. On the Sales/Invoicing form certain conditions would cause the total to be
    erroneously set to 0.

33. On the Maintain Inventory form the accounts on the General tab were sometimes
    being set to the default values.

34. On the Maintain Customer form ShipTo Addresses tab the address zipcode was
    not being saved.

35. The SalesJournal object GetForInvoice method was returning an arbitrary value
    with status = btStatusOK if the record was not found instead of a btEOF status.

36. On the Maintain Customer, Maintain Inventory Item and Maintain Vendor forms
    entering an ID of more than 20 characters caused an error.

37. When no price level data was available an error was occuring on refresh.

38. For V9 only, the Purchase Journal, Purchase Order Journal, and Sales

    correctly for PT V8 and V9.

New Methods and Properties PawCom Object Library
------------------------------------------------
V10 (2003) support has been added for all classes and some additional methods
and properties have been defined.  The classes have been updated as follows:

Throughout the properties Key, TrxNumber, and MaxTrxNumber are now obsolete.
The properties will continue to work but no longer support longer TrxNumbers
that have been defined in V10.  (This was a case of "be careful what you ask
for - you may get it." We reported to Peachtree that the TrxNumber was too
small to hold period 0 records for very active companies that had several
years of data.  They heard us and fixed the problem by changing the TrxNumber
from integer to long.  Hurrah!  Unfortunately that broke the definitions
for anything relating to the TrxNumber.)
